# NEW PCA FOLDER

> Everything's getting messy.

- Isolated PCA code calculated using `prcomp` (same as lectures) is in `PCA.qmd`.
- Any analysis you do on the PC's should ideally be done in a separate file, loading in the PC data at the start.
  - I'm just putting my code inside `/Flynn`.

**For example:**

```{r}
load("PCA_results.RData")

summary(pca_result)

# This is what is used in regression!
pca_scores <- pca_result$x

# loadings (contributions of each variable to the components)
pca_loadings <- pca_result$rotation

# Plot the variance explained by each principal component
plot(pca_result, type = "l")
```
